In this project, I demonstrate essential data analysis skills by efficiently organizing, cleaning, transforming, analyzing, 
and visualizing bike ride data for a fictional bike share company, Ridez. This endeavor aims to provide actionable insights, 
enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize revenue and improve business strategies at Ridez.

The project tries to answer the question, ‘How different are annual members from casual riders at Ridez?’ 
This question focuses on understanding the differences between two important customer groups: annual members and casual riders. 
By analyzing and comparing these groups, I provide valuable insights that Ridez can use to make data-driven decisions and 
potentially tailor their services or marketing strategies to better serve each group.
